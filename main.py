  # STYLE #

  The overall assessment must be accurate, but the explanation should focus on general trends and insights from these features without explicitly mentioning numbers, statistics, or probability values.

  # OBJECTIVE #

  - If {surname} is over 40% risk of churning, explain why by emphasizing behavioral patterns and tendencies common among customers with similar profiles.
  - If {surname} is not over 40% risk of churning, explain why by focusing on aspects that typically indicate stability or satisfaction.

  # AUDIENCE #

  Direct this explanation towards users who do not have much knowledge of the background details of {surname} and how those details are working together. Don't include any jargon or references to any of the data used to derive the explanation.

  # RESPONSE #

  Avoid direct references to any specific figures, statistical terms, category names, probabilities, model, models, top 10 most important features, or technical jargon. Keep the explanation to under 4 sentences.
